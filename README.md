# Poetry Management System

This Java-based Poetry Management System is designed to organize and manage a collection of poems. The project incorporates various technologies, design patterns, and best practices to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache SQL:** The project utilizes Apache SQL for efficient and reliable database operations.

- **Design Patterns:**
  - **Facade:** Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in the system.
  - **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
  - **Dependency Injection:** Promotes loose coupling by injecting dependencies into the classes that need them.
  - **Dependency Inversion:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
  - **State Design:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

- **Architecture:**
  - **Layered Architecture:** The codebase follows a layered architecture for better organization and separation of concerns.

- **Testing:**
  - **JUnit Testing:** The project achieves full path coverage through comprehensive JUnit tests.

- **Configuration Files (Cfg's):**
  - Configuration files are used to manage settings and parameters for easy customization.

- **Java Swing:**
  - The user interface is built using Java Swing for a user-friendly and interactive experience.

- **Log4j:**
  - Log4j is implemented for efficient logging and debugging.

- **SOLID Principles:**
  - The code adheres to SOLID principles for better maintainability, scalability, and readability.

- **Code Smells Resolved:**
  - The project identifies and resolves code smells to ensure high code quality.

- **Code Refactoring:**
  - Continuous efforts are made to refactor the code for improved readability and maintainability.

- **JavaDocs:**
  - Comprehensive JavaDocs are provided for better code documentation.
